## Introduction


This app provides a handwriting-based AI assistant with text-to-speech responses. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.


## Data We Collect and How We Use It


### 1. Handwriting Input (Strokes)


- **What:** Digital ink strokes from your handwriting
- **How used:** Converted to text using third-party recognition services (Google Digital Ink Recognition API)
- **Storage:** **NOT STORED**. Processed in device memory only and immediately discarded after recognition
- **Why:** To recognize your handwriting and convert it to text for AI processing


### 2. Recognized Text Input


- **What:** Text converted from your handwriting
- **How used:** Sent to AI service (Google Gemini) to generate responses
- **Storage:** **NOT STORED**. A non-identifying category label is created (e.g., "Sleep," "Learning," "Relaxation") but no actual text content is saved
- **Why:** To provide AI-generated responses to your questions


### 3. Topic Labels (Non-Identifying)


- **What:** Generic category labels like "Sleep & Rest," "Learning," "Relaxation," etc.
- **How used:** To track conversation context for follow-up questions
- **Storage:** Stored temporarily on your device during active session
- **Why:** To enable natural conversation flow (e.g., asking follow-up questions)


### 4. AI Responses


- **What:** Text responses generated by the AI
- **How used:** Displayed on screen and converted to speech
- **Storage:** Last response is cached **locally on your device** for replay functionality
- **Retention:** Automatically deleted after 2 hours or when you clear the app
- **Why:** To allow replaying the last answer without making duplicate AI requests


### 5. Text-to-Speech Audio


- **What:** Spoken audio of AI responses
- **How used:** Generated on your device using native device TTS (Text-to-Speech via Expo Speech)
- **Storage:** **NOT STORED**. Generated in real-time and played immediately
- **Why:** To provide audio responses for eyes-free listening


### 6. Background Music


- **What:** Optional ambient background music
- **How used:** Played from local audio files bundled with the app
- **Storage:** Audio files are part of the app installation, not uploaded or transmitted
- **Why:** To provide a relaxing atmosphere during use


### 7. Account Information (If Logged In)


- **What:** Email address and authentication tokens (via Supabase Auth)
- **How used:** To manage your account, subscription tier, and usage limits
- **Storage:** Stored securely in our database (Supabase)
- **Why:** To provide account-based features and premium subscriptions


### 8. Subscription and Payment Information


- **What:** Subscription status, purchase receipts, payment transactions
- **How used:** To manage premium subscriptions and verify purchase status
- **Storage:** Handled by RevenueCat and Apple/Google payment systems (not stored on our servers)
- **Why:** To provide premium features and manage subscription access


### 9. Usage Metrics


- **What:** Number of requests made, subscription tier, usage counters
- **How used:** To enforce rate limits and manage subscriptions
- **Storage:** Stored in our database
- **Why:** To provide fair usage across all users and manage subscription features
